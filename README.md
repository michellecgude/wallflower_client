### Progress: Currently in refactoring mode.

What began as an application that had no backend database is now being built into a full-stack application with python/django, postgreSQL, and JWT/Djoser authentication to support.

Here is a peak at the frontend/React landing page prior to signing up for the application. This is a snippet of the visual UX/UI of the work in progress...

You can view these wireframes [here](https://www.figma.com/file/j5MhaL5vLUckgi5mOKQwRB/%F0%9F%8C%BC-%F0%9F%8C%BC-%F0%9F%8C%BC?node-id=197%3A22), which is a link to my Figma design. (Everything you see was designed by me.)

This README.md will be updated upon completion on the refractoring of the application.

Keep checking back for updates!

# Wallflower

Wallflower is a COVID-inspired mental health application based around providing positive, personalized experiences for those most affected by the pandemic.

This app best serves those who are:

> - Frontline Healthcare Workers
> - Recently unemployed
> - Mourning the loss of a loved one to the disease
> - Currently sick (or had been sick) with COVID-19
> - Struggling with pre-existing mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and/or OCD.
> - Feeling lonely or isolated due to social distancing

## About

Wallflower is culmination of what I've learned both in and outside of General Assembly. Read more about where it started [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-covid-taught-me-heal-inspired-code-showed-we-have-michelle-gude/).

#### The branding/design behind wallflower

As a software developer first, artist second, I wanted to take this project seriously and make it into something that showcases all of my skills. Prior to coding, I created a visual branding guide and UX/UI board for it which you can find on ~~both Dribble and Behance.~~ [ *currently in progress* ]

## Features

Wallflower has several key features all meant to empower users to be their own "self-caretakers" while also bringing a bit of daily positivity along the way.

- Personalized meditations
- Free journal entries
- Daily dose of `r/aww` via the [RedditAPI](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/).
- Personalized uplifting news
