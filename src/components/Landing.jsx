        <span id="aside-intro">In just this past year,</span> COVID-19 disrupted
        the rythym of normal life, turned bustling cities into quiet spaces, and
        society into a petri dish. Funnily enough, the virus in its totality all
        fits into a single soda can, but what we often forget is that even small
        foes are capable of bringing about lasting impact. To many, normalcy
        seems a vaccine away. But the suffering doesn’t end when the total
        infected count hits zero. It lingers. It lingers in the mind. For nearly
        a third of Americans report feeling increased depression and anxiety
        since the start of the pandemic. That doesn’t account for the additional
        psychological stressors that frontline healthcare workers face, as well
        as the newly unemployed, amongst others. Millions of individuals are
        predicted to come out of the COVID pandemic carrying some kind of trauma
        upon their back. Which begs the question, what is there to do about the
        following “mental health pandemic” many experts are worried about? This
        question is what inspired me to develop wallflower. Simple, minimal, and
        action-driven; walllflower is a mental health, self-care application
        designed to help individuals most affected by the pandemic heal through
        awareness-building, science-backed methods. For some, taking care of
        their mental health can seem daunting, overbearing, and at times,
        complicated. Wallflower aims at making mental health more accessible,
        and, more positive. It’s about time we move forward as a community and
        begin to heal from the pandemic together.
